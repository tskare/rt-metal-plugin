# Metal Real-Time Audio Plugin Example / Module

This repository aims to provide a starter project and research platform for running metal kernels in-process in real-time audio plugins on MacOS and iOS devices.

It is *under construction*; the following major items remain before a stable 1.0 release:
- Additional practically usable, non-synthetic, examples in the example repo.
- Testing on iOS
- Splitting the JUCE module and examples into two repositories so the module is as small as possible.
- Better API documentation -- what's here is AI-generated as a placeholder
- Possibly merging a "dynamic effects rack" that can load and optionally fuse kernels; see research repository at [gh:tskare/gpu-modular-effects-chain](https://github.com/tskare/gpu-modular-effects-chain), though that example is a console example in Swift.
- Implementing any feedback anyone has!

This repository consists of sub-components:

1. JUCE module in `modules/ts_metal_accel` - will be separated out into its own repository soon so it can be checked out as a submodule.
2. Bare-bones projects when using kernels for synthesis (output larger than input) and effect processing (similar sizes) tasks. These will only display some basic statistics and do some dummy processing (gain or a filter) on the GPU. These are the ideal starting points for your projects.
3. `modules/ts_metal_accel_fdtd` is a sample 3D FDTD reverb. It can maximize use of one Metal GPU core (systems have around 10 these days); note that there is no cross-threadgroup barrier and we could not launch one kernel per sample in real-time so this is likely an archietectural limit when there are sample level dependencies in the grid.

There are additionally two "phases" to the project; the second may be needed for practical software.

1. Synchronously calls metal kernels in `processBlock` which is far from realtime-safe
2. Asynchronous producer-consumer version with configurable number of buffers of latency.

## AI Disclosure

I'm using this repository to do more coding to learn and compare AI agents' console tools (currently Claude, Gemini, Codex).
- The codebase was iteratively reviewed and revised with suggestions from each
- Tests and the FDTD reverb example were mostly AI-generated from a plan markdown file and comments.
- The API documentation is completely AI-generated as well.

## Third-party Resources and licenses

Internally we use the Apple [metal-cpp](https://developer.apple.com/metal/cpp/) bindings. These are included as vendored code with the project.

The example uses the nice Pamplejuce project as a template for nice modern C++, test, benchmark, and CI infrastructure. Please see [gh:sudara/pamplejuce](https://github.com/sudara/pamplejuce/) for more information.

The project is based on JUCE which is installed as a submodule via CPM, preferably with caching.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Configure build
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja

# Build standalone plugin
cmake --build build --target MetalAudioPlugin_Standalone --config Debug

# Run tests
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

## Build-your-own

See the [module README](modules/ts_metal_accel/README.md) for API usage examples.

Note at this stage the API is not yet locked, but we're getting close!

## FDTD Reverb Demo

Enable the "FDTD Reverb" toggle in the standalone plugin to hear the 3D finite-difference solver running on the GPU. Room size, absorption, and wet/dry mix are exposed as realtime controls; source and microphone defaults live in `PluginProcessor::configureFDTD()`. CPU/GPU implementation notes are documented in `modules/ts_metal_accel/README.md`.

The reverb now runs through the asynchronous Metal worker that mirrors the main accelerator:

- The new "Process Reverb on GPU" toggle lets you force the CPU path when profiling or running on unsupported hardware. When disabled, the wet path is emitted synchronously with zero additional latency.
- GPU queue health is surfaced directly in the editor (frames processed, queue depth, underruns, watchdog trips, CPU enqueue/copy timings). This makes it easy to spot overloads or starvation in different DAW buffer configurations.
- When hosts present very large buffer sizes the engine automatically clamps the requested room size so the GPU queue stays within the one-block deadline. The status string reflects the active grid.
- GPU errors or watchdog timeouts fall back to the CPU solver seamlesslyâ€”audio keeps flowing while the UI reports the failure.
